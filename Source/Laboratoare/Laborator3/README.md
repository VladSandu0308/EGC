# Laboratory 3
2D Transformations in *OpenGL* using `glm`

## Tasks
3 squares are translated, rotated and scaled in `Laborator3.cpp`

`Laborator3_Vis2D.cpp` showcases viewport transformations:
- zoom in/out
- translations

## Bonus
The bonus aims to mimic a *Sun - Earth - Moon* relation between 3 squares:
- the inner square (the Sun) is stationary
- the middle one (the Earth) rotates around the inner
- the outer square (the Moon) rotates around the latter
