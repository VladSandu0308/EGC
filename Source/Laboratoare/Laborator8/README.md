Phong illumination.

Essentially identical to the (Gouraud illumination)[https://github.com/teodutu/EGC/blob/master/Source/Laboratoare/Laborator7/README.md] 
just that now the light is mo longer calculated per vertex and then interpolated
in the *Fragment Shader*, but claculated in the *Fragment Shader* itself.
